Access

An authorised API key is required to gain access to each GraphQL API by setting the x-api-key header on each POST request. If you do not have an API key, or have any other questions around access, please contact our Support Team.

Discover

To interact and discover what is available via GRID APIs, the following development tools are maintained.

GraphQL Playground

GraphQL is a language that enables a flexible approach to querying APIs, by enabling the client to query only what is required. Most APIs offered as part of the GRID data feeds are queryable with GraphQL.

In order to discover and test different GraphQL queries across these APIs, the GraphQL Playground is available that allows live queries for real data. It is possible to view the schema for each API using the panel located on the right-hand side of the playground application.

Data Feed Viewer

The Data Feed Viewer enables consumers to discover the events data contained within transactions, published by the Series Events API.

Understanding the results

The output of the GetCsgoLoopfeedSeries query provides static data for the CSGO Loopfeed series (a demo CSGO series running cyclically on the GRID Platform). The following key data points are included:

Series: the parent entity. Note that a series may contain other entities within it. Our query shows that this series has an ID, which can be used to identify it in the GRID Data Platform.

startTimeScheduled: indicates the scheduled start time of the series. In this example, the series begins on the 18th of November at 13:34hs.

format: specifies how many games are included in the series and how the winner will be determined. In this example, the series is a "best of three" (Bo3), which means up to three games will be played.

Title: the title refers to the game being played. One of the title data points is nameShortened, which is a commonly used abbreviation for the game. In this example, the title is CSGO, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Note that the title's full name and the GRID ID can also be requested as part of the query.

Tournament: the tournament provides context for where a series is being played. In this example, as this is a test series, the tournament is GRID-TEST. However, in real series, you can find tournaments such as The Champion of Champions Tour.

Teams: the teams show who will be playing in the game.

baseInfo: provides some of the most relevant information about a team. We obtain the team’s name in the example, but additional data points are available.

scoreAdvantage: a team can start a series with a game advantage. In the example, none of the teams has an advantage.

Additional Resources

The example includes only some of the GRID Central Data Feed's data points. Please refer to the GraphQL API Schema documentation for a comprehensive list of the available data points. The Schema documentation can be accessed by clicking the Docs button in the GraphQL Playground.

Static Data Overview

The Central Data Feed is the repository of GRID's static data.

The term "static data" refers to information regarding an entity not associated with in-game data.

For instance, data points related to a team, such as its name, logo, branding colors, and the title in which they compete, are considered static data.

These data points remain constant during a series and are not affected by any in-game events; thus, GRID categorizes them as static data.

Central Data URLs

There are two URLs that can be used to access Central Data. One is for Open Access users and the other is for clients with commercial level access.

Open Access URL

https://api-op.grid.gg/central-data/graphql

Full Access URL

https://api.grid.gg/central-data/graphql

Static Data Entities

Players, teams, titles, tournaments, and series are the primary entities in the Central Data Feed.

Relationships

Entities in the Central Data Feed are interconnected and can be represented as nodes in a graph. The relationship between entities is denoted by edges (see GraphQL connections), with additional information about the relationship included in the relationship fields (e.g. scoreAdvantage for a team participant relationship on the series entity).

For instance, in the context of a best-of-three series between C9 White and G2 Gozen for Valorant Game Changers, a Series entity can be linked to several other entities to obtain their respective data.

Players

Players represent the individuals participating in games. This entity is used in the Live Data to keep track of players between different matches consistently.

Teams

Teams identify groups of players participating in games.

Related entity: Team Participant

This entity can be found in Series, and has the information of the team, alongside the score advantage for a given series.

Titles

Titles describe the games supported by GRID. For example, Valorant, CSGO and DotA are some of the supported titles. They play an important role in defining the Live Data Feed. While all the GRID APIs are title-agnostic, events and states may have small differences between titles to express the game state fully.

Tournaments

Tournaments are competitions in which teams participate.

Series

A Series represents a minimum of one game played by two teams in a tournament context. The Series entity in the Central Data Feed does not track in-game events but instead records data points related to scheduling, context, and format.

Related entity: Series Format

The format of a series determines the number of games played and how the winner is determined. For example, BO1 and BO3 formats, respectively, "best-of-1" and "best-of-3", indicate that one or up to three games are played. The winner of a BO1 series wins with one game, and the winner of a BO3 series wins with two games.

Related entity: Product Service Level

The service level indicates the type of coverage GRID offers for a given series in each product. The value of this field can be FULL, LIMITED and NONE.

Related entity: Video Stream

The video stream entity provides the URL for a series's live video stream.

Static Data FAQ

Is more detailed information about tournaments and teams available?

GRID currently offers all static information available about tournaments and teams through the APIs. We are continuously working towards increasing the level of detail of all available information and will provide incremental updates to extend its support in the future.

Is any information relating to players' rosters/lineups supported?

The APIs currently do not support a team's expected roster / lineup, although this feature is being worked on and will be supported in the future.

n-Game Data Quick-Start Guide

Prerequisites

Before querying for in-game data, you must obtain an API key. You can acquire one from our Support Team. Additionally, you must have access to a tool able to make GraphQL requests, such as the GraphQL Playground or Postman.

Run a query using the GRID Playground

Fill in the API KEY text input with your API key.

Choose the entity you wish to query from the tabs above the editor. LDF Series State is the tab related to the Live Data Feed Series State.

The left panel will show one pre-filled query: GetLiveDotaSeriesState.

To run the query, click the play button at the top of the Playground.

After running the query, the right panel will display the resulting data in JSON format.

Understand the results

The output of the GetLiveDotaSeriesState query provides the live data for a series, the DotA Loopfeed series in this case (a demo DotA series running cyclically on the GRID Platform). The following key data points are included:

Series: data points for a series. Numerous other entities, such as Teams, Players, and Games are nested within this entity. Some data points provided by the static data API are also included in this entity.

valid: denotes whether the data for this series is accurate, based on GRID's assessment. This implies that no issues have been reported to the team.

updatedAt: indicates the time of the last update to this series.

format: specifies how many games are included in the series and how the winner will be determined. In this example, the series is a "best of three" (Bo3), which means up to three games will be played.

started: indicates whether the series has begun.

finished: indicates whether the series has concluded.

teams: provides the name of each team participating in the Series and information regarding whether they have won the series. It is important to note that this data point is on a "series level," implying that it is unrelated to the outcome of individual games. Data points are aggregated on a series level.

games: provides all supported data points for a game.

sequenceNumber: indicates the order in which games have been played.

teams: provides the teams' data points aggregated on a game level.

name: indicates the name of the team.

players: provides the data points for players aggregated on a game level.

kills: indicates the amount of kills a player got in the game.

deaths: indicates how many times the player died in a game.

netWorth: indicates the sum of the player’s inventory value and their current money.

money: indicates the total amount of money the player possesses.

position: the X/Y coordinates of where the player is standing on the map.

Additional Resources

The example includes only some of the GRID Live Data Feed's data points. Please refer to the GraphQL API Schema documentation for a comprehensive list of the available data points. The Schema documentation can be accessed by clicking the Docs button in the GraphQL Playground.

In-Game Data Overview

The GRID data platform enables you to get in-game data via its APIs. By definition this is all data generated by the title’s game server, either

Directly, like a team planting the Spike in Valorant or slaying Roshan in DotA

Indirectly, like a team winning a series after winning 2 games in a Best-of-3 format

The in-game data’s scope is a series, meaning that any in-game data is tracked across one series and not multiple. In-game data refers back to static data, which can be used to tie data for entities across multiple series together.

In-game data includes both

The latest state of a series

Events that happened throughout a series

GRID’s data structure is title-agnostic, meaning that it is the same across all supported titles. This does not mean that all state data points and events are applicable to all titles; only that when they are applicable, they work in exactly the same way.

Series State

The state of a series gives you a snapshot of the latest situation. This state changes over time while the series is ongoing.

Examples of state are

The total kills of a player throughout a series

Whether or not a team has won a game already

A player’s current money and inventory

Series State URLs

There are two URLs that can be used to access the Series State API. One is for Open Access users and the other is for clients with commercial level access.

Open Access URL

https://api-op.grid.gg/live-data-feed/series-state/graphql

Full Access URL

https://api.grid.gg/live-data-feed/series-state/graphql

Data structure

The state of a series follows a hierarchy containing different state levels:

Series

Games

Segments

Segments

…

Each series consists of games being played. Each game can consist of multiple segments being played. Each segment can consist of multiple segments being played and so on. A segment can thus represent

A part of a game, like a round in Valorant

A part of another segment, like the Buy Phase of that round

The state is structured in such a way that the same data points are aggregated on all state levels, for example the total kills throughout the whole series, a single game or a segment of a game. Some data can not be aggregated and only appears on specific state levels, like whether or not a segment is finished yet.

Additionally, state data points are also aggregated per individual participant of a series, like the total kills of a team in a game. These aggregates are available on each state level and follow the following hierarchy:

Teams

Players

Each team’s data points also hold the data points for the players playing for that team.

Getting the latest state

Using our Series State API it is possible to get the latest state of a series. In the request you can ask for exactly the state data points you’re interested in. That way the responses are as quick and minimal as possible.

The state updates as actions happen during an ongoing series. By default, the state will be synchronized with the official broadcast stream.

Currently we don’t offer a way to listen for state changes. If you want to keep knowing about the latest state of an ongoing series, you’ll have to request it again every so often depending on your use case and up to a limit. If you request the state too often and break that limit you’ll get a response telling you to back off from sending more requests for some time.

The state at the end of the series remains accessible after the series is finished. This enables you to request data for past series as well. You can also download the full state for a past series as a file using our File Download API.

You can use our GraphQL Playground to try getting the latest state of a series yourself without having to write any code. We continuously replay test series so you can try it out even when there’s no esports series ongoing.

Series Events

The Series Events API provides real-time, structured updates for ongoing esports series across major titles like CS2, DOTA 2, League of Legends, VALORANT, PUBG, and Rainbow Six Siege. Delivered as JSON transactions over WebSocket, each update contains both the events that occurred and the resulting full or partial state of the series, games, teams, and players.

This API is not included in the Open Access program

What can the Series Events API be used for?

The API enables clients to:

Track Live Progress: Instantly follow match flow, including starts/ends, objectives, kills, and more.

Access State* Snapshots: On connection or via configuration, receive a complete state snapshot to sync or reconstruct the current match at any time.

Filter and Customize Data: Use configuration payloads to filter for specific events or request full state inclusion for selected events.

Handle Game Restorations: On connection or via configuration, receive a complete state snapshot to sync or reconstruct the current match at any time.

Integrate with Reference Data: Combine live state with static data** from the Central Data API for richer applications.

*State is the current situation of the series including data like game number, score, kills, networth etc.

**Static data in this context is data that doesn’t change often such as fixtures, team/player/tournament information etc.

Example Use Cases

Live Broadcasts & Visualization: Power real-time overlays, scoreboards, and in-game stats for esports productions.

Analytics & Insights: Feed data into analytics tools for player performance, economy, and event timelines.

Betting & Integrity: Provide up-to-date, accurate data for betting platforms and integrity monitoring.

Coaching & Review: Enable coaches and analysts to reconstruct matches for review or highlight generation.

Fan Engagement: Drive interactive apps, fantasy games, and notifications based on real-time game events.

Key Features

Hierarchical State Model: Series → Games → Segments → Teams → Players.

Event-Driven & Stateful: Each event carries both its delta* and the resulting state.

Configurable Streams: Filter and tailor the feed to your needs.

Robust Restoration Support: Built-in workflows for re-connection situations.

Cross-Title Consistency: Unified schema with title-specific extensions.

*Delta state is the change from the last known state. For example if a kill happens in a series the kills delta in the message is going to be 1.

Testing tools

The Series Events API offers a suite of tools and resources to help you test, validate, and integrate your applications before going live with production data. These tools are designed to simulate live series data, provide easy visualization, and allow for robust end-to-end testing.

Feed Viewer

The Feed Viewer is a web-based tool for connecting to any live or test Series Events feed. It allows you to:

Connect using your authentication key and a Series ID or Player ID.

Visualize real-time transactions and events as they are published.

Inspect full state snapshots and event deltas.

Experiment with configuration options and filtering.

![][image1]

How to Access

Visit The Feed Viewer which is publicly accessible. Enter the Series ID (including any Test Loop Series ID) and your authentication key to begin streaming data.

Test Loop Series

GRID provides dedicated Test Loop Series for each supported title. These are continuously running, simulated series that loop through matches for testing purposes. By connecting to a Test Loop Series, you can:

Receive a constant stream of realistic, title-specific events and state changes.

Test your integration, parsing, and visualization logic in a safe environment.

Validate your application's handling of all event types.

GRID File Download API

Overview

The File Download API allows the download of comprehensive gameplay data in file format. This REST API enables users to verify the availability of files for a specific series and obtain the corresponding download links.

For series of the supported titles, users can download the GRID State and Events data files. Additionally, for selected titles, users can download official files provided by game developers, such as Riot Game Agnostic Match History and LiveStats files.

The API is available through the following URL:

https://api.grid.gg/file-download

Specifications

A comprehensive OpenAPI specification is available on the GRID CDN.

File types

This section provides an overview of each available file type, along with a description of its content.

GRID State

As a convenience, the GRID state available on the Series State API can also be downloaded as a file in uncompressed JSON format.

Please refer to the Series State API data structure section for detailed information on the file's content.

Note that while obtaining the full GRID State as a file is helpful for a quick start, it is recommended to use the Series State API directly for a more straightforward understanding of the data structure outlined in its schema. Similar to other GRID GraphQL APIs, the Series State API provides schema documentation and allows the selection of specific data points.

GRID Events

This file type is available in compressed JSONL (as in JSON Lines) format.

The file is composed of transactions, each holding one or more events that occurred at the same time. Each event includes the actor who has caused the event, the action taken and the target of the event. It also includes how the event has changed the GRID state.

Quick-start guide

Prerequisites

To access the File download API, the following prerequisites are required:

The GRID API access key. The same API access key can be used across all GRID APIs. If not yet available, an access key can be requested by contacting Support Team,

a tool capable of executing HTTP GET requests, such as curl, Postman, Insomnia

Steps

Obtain the series ID for which files would be downloaded. The series IDs are shown in the Match History Viewer or can be retrieved from the Central Data Feed.

Get available files for a series by executing an HTTP GET request, including your key, as described in the Authentication section of the document. For example, when querying for series ID 2537521 with the API key being personal-api-key, the request using curl would be the following:

curl -i -H "x-api-key: personal-api-key" https://api.grid.gg/file-download/list/2537521

Stats Feed Overview

The GRID Stats Feed comprises a set of APIs that present the aggregated values of in-game data in order to produce customizable statistics and analytics.

The GRID Stats Feed leverages the quality of official data and the game-title-agnostic capabilities of the GRID Data Platform to create a comprehensive, easily accessible suite of statistics, which enables users to create bespoke insights for their audiences.

The GRID Stats Feed offers aggregated statistics for teams and players for a given series or game sample. For example, the win rate over the last three months, the minimum/maximum/average kills in a tournament, or the number of structures destroyed per match in the last year.

Access

The Stats Feed API is a GraphQL API that can be accessed using the following endpoint:

https://api-op.grid.gg/statistics-feed/graphql

In order to make requests, authentication using an API key is required. This key can be added to the request by setting the following header.

For a list of GraphQL tools available for a multitude of different languages, see here.

Please note: the tools linked above are not maintained or supported by GRID esports and license information for each should be understood and adhered to.

Filters

The Stats Feed allows the definition of series or game samples with different conditions. For example, by tournament or time window.

Name

Type

Description

tournamentIds

IdFilter

Allows filtering by up to 20 Tournament IDs.

timeWindow

TimeRangeFilter

Allows filtering by a set time frame.

Other sampling conditions are supported depending on the query. See the API Reference for further details.

Limitations

The following limitations have to be considered when using the filters:

The tournamentIds and timeWindows filters are mutually exclusive; using both will return a BAD_REQUEST error.

Only users with access to all series of a title can use the timeWindow filter.

Users with tournament-specific permissions are required to use the tournamentIds filter.

Statistics Structure

The Stats Feed follows a very similar structure to GRID Series State API, where Segments (rounds) are nested inside Games, which in turn are nested inside Series (matches).

The following high-level stats are currently supported; refer to the API Reference for detailed information.

Term

Description

Notes

teamStatistics

Analyses the performance of a specified team in a series sample. Data points are aggregated by the team ID and by series, games, and segment.

For example, sum/min/max/avg kills of the series played in the last three months for team with ID=1234

teamGameStatistics

Analyses the performance of a specified team in a game sample. Data points are aggregated by the team ID and by games and segment.

For example, sum/min/max/avg kills of the games played on a specific map during a tournament for the team with ID=1234

playerStatistics

Analyses the performance of a specified player in a series sample. Data points are aggregated by the player ID and by series, games, and segments.

For example, sum/min/max/avg kills of the series played in the last year for the player with ID=1234

Example

Query the sum, minimum, maximum, and average of the kills, deaths, and net worth the CSGO team with id 45021 scored in the last six months. Also, query the win rate and the shortest, longest, and current win streak.

Try it out

}

Supported Titles

The Stats Feed API follows GRID’s title-agnostic design principle and is available for all GRID-supported titles, including League of Legends, Counter Strike 2, Defense of the Ancients 2, Valorant, PUBG, Rainbow Six: Siege*.

*Title support may be limited to specific statistics. See the Statistics Structure section for details.

Supported Statistics

Some of the statistics the GRID Stats API supports are: count (of series, games, rounds), kills, killAssistsGiven, killAssistsReceived, teamkills, teamkillAssistsGiven, teamkillAssistsReceived, selfkills, deaths, headshots, structuresDestroyed, structuresCaptured, score and wins.

See the API reference for a comprehensive list of the supported statistics and their description.

Statistics types

Statistics can be of different types depending on their purpose.

Int

This type of statistic is a single aggregated integer.

Example

Total number of Series for the applied filter (count):

{

  "data": {

    "teamStatistics": {

      "series": {

        "count": 244

      }

    }

  }

}

The above response shows that 244 Series were included in this range (title ID, team ID & time window).

AggregateIntStatistic

This type of statistic is an aggregation of integer fields, which includes the total (sum), the minimum (min), the maximum (max) and the average (avg). Some of the statistics using this type are kills, killAssistsGiven, killAssistsReceived, teamkills, teamkillAssistsGiven, teamkillAssistsReceived, selfkills, deaths, headshots, structuresDestroyed, structuresCaptured and score.

Example

Sum, min, max and avg values of kills (Series level) and netWorth (Game level) Total number of Series in range (count) for the applied filter:

{

  "data": {

    "teamStatistics": {

      "series": {

        "kills": {

          "sum": 55807,

          "min": 90,

          "max": 459,

          "avg": 228.7172131147541

        }

      },

      "game": {

        "count": 598,

        "netWorth": {

          "sum": 11342450,

          "min": 1100,

          "max": 80800,

          "avg": 18967.30769230769

        }

      }

    }

  }

}

The above response shows that the team had a total of 55807 kills, with minimum, maximum and average values of 90, 459 and 228.71, respectively per Series. The net worth of all the players across all games was 11342450 with a minimum, maximum and average value of 1100, 80800 and 18967.3 per Game, respectively.

BooleanOccurenceStatistic

This type of statistic counts the total number (count) of occurrences for a certain boolean condition (Boolean), such as, for example, a Team having won a Game. Additional statistics are also provided, such as the percentage value as well as the following streak-related statistics: min, max and current.

Example

Game win statistics for the applied filter:

{

  "data": {

    "teamStatistics": {

      "game": {

        "wins": [

          {

            "value": false,

            "count": 320,

            "percentage": 53.333333333333336,

            "streak": {

              "min": 1,

              "max": 14,

              "current": 4

            }

          },

          {

            "value": true,

            "count": 280,

            "percentage": 46.666666666666664,

            "streak": {

              "min": 1,

              "max": 10,

              "current": 0

            }

          }

        ]

      }

    }

  }

}

The above response shows that the team lost 320 Games, corresponding to 53.33% of the total Games played in the period. The shortest losing streak was 1 Game, while the longest was 14. They are currently on a 4 game losing streak. Respectively, the statistics for games won are 280 total, a 46.66% win rate, a shortest winning streak of 1, a longest winning streak of 10 and a current winning streak of 0.

Post-Game Data API Overview 

This document outlines the process for transmitting post-game data to the GRID Data Platform, making it accessible via the GRID Post-Game API. It details the key integration steps, including sending commands that represent in-game actions (like kills or item pickups) and updating the overall game state.

Key aspects of the integration include:

Commands: Data is transmitted as JSON commands via HTTPS to the GRID Telemetry API.

Game State Updates: The UPDATE_BASIC_GAME_STATE command provides an overview of the game's final state.

Actions: Individual actions within the game can be tracked using specific commands (e.g., KILL_ENEMY_PLAYER).

Player Positions: The UPDATE_PLAYER_POSITIONS command allows for tracking player coordinates over time.

Correlation ID: This ID allows associating actions, position updates, and state changes for synchronized processing.

API Key: Provided by GRID, along with title IDs for production and testing.

OpenAPI Specification: The grid_openapi_post_game_api.yaml file is provided to define the API structure, viewable in the Swagger Editor. Link to Download

A game integration process generally involves a collaborative effort with GRID's Solutions Architects, who assist in designing, implementing, testing, and monitoring the integration.

It's imporant to note that not all data is required to be transmitted and data entities (teams, players, etc.) can be dynamically created or pre-created.

If there are any questions, always feel free to reach out to support@grid.gg.

Post-Game Data API Quick-Start Guide

This guide will get you up and running with the basics of transmitting post-game data to the GRID Data Platform.

1. Prerequisites:

API key, 'title id' (for production), and 'test title id' (for development) from GRID.

grid_openapi_post_game_api.yaml file (OpenAPI specification). Link to Download

A game server or system capable of sending HTTPS requests.

Familiarity with JSON data format.

2. Set up your environment:

Use the provided API keys and title IDs. Keep the production and test credentials separate.

Open the grid_openapi_post_game_api.yaml file in the Swagger Editor to explore the API structure and available commands.

3. Transmit basic game state:

After a game ends, send an UPDATE_BASIC_GAME_STATE command via HTTP.

Include a unique game ID in the request.

This single command is enough to make game statistics available through the GRID Post-Game GraphQL API.

Example (Conceptual JSON):

{

  "command": "UPDATE_BASIC_GAME_STATE",

  "game_id": "your_unique_game_id",

  "game_result": "win",

  "player_count": 10

  //... other relevant game state data

}

4. Enhance with Actions:

For each significant in-game action (e.g., kill, item pickup), transmit the corresponding command (e.g., KILL_ENEMY_PLAYER).

The OpenAPI specification details available commands and required fields.

Example (Conceptual JSON):

{

    "command": "KILL_ENEMY_PLAYER",

    "killer_id": "player123",

    "victim_id": "player456",

    "game_id": "your_unique_game_id"

}

5. Track Player Positions:

Use the UPDATE_PLAYER_POSITIONS command to send player coordinates.

Include this command whenever an action occurs. Use a "correlation id" to link actions and positions.

Send UPDATE_PLAYER_POSITIONS at regular intervals (e.g., once per second) for continuous tracking.

Example (Conceptual JSON):

{

    "command": "UPDATE_PLAYER_POSITIONS",

    "correlation_id": "unique_action_id",

    "positions": [

        {

            "player_id": "player123",

            "x": 10.5,

            "y": 20.2,

            "z": 5.0

        }

      // ... more player positions

    ]

}

6. Advanced State Changes:

Send UPDATE_BASIC_GAME_STATE commands periodically to reflect ongoing changes in the game.

Correlate these updates with actions or positions using the same "correlation id" if necessary.

7. Verification:

After sending data, verify that it's available via the GRID Post-Game GraphQL API using the game ID.

Key Considerations:

Work with GRID's integration specialists to design a tailored plan.

Transmit only the data relevant to your game.

Use your own IDs for data entities (players, teams, etc.).

GRID provides support for managing data entity mappings.

Choose a transmission strategy (single batch or real-time) that suits your game server's architecture.

This guide provides a high-level overview. Please refer to the full documentation and OpenAPI specification for detailed information on all available commands and parameters.

Post-Game Visualisations Overview

Product Walkthrough: Analyzing Post Game Data

1. Navigating to Post Game Data

Start on the Game Selection Page: You'll begin on the main screen where you can see a list of your games.

Filters: Use the "Filters" section to narrow down your game selection. You can filter by "GAME TITLE" or "PLAYERS".

Game Details: On the Game Selection Page, you'll see a list of individual matches or sessions played. You can from this view see overview information, such as a Game/Session ID, Game Duration, Map Played and Game Score.

Choose a Match: Click on the game or session you want to analyze further. This will take you to the "Post Game Data" page. You also have the option to download the game file directly from here.

2. Exploring the Post Game Data Page

Statistics Table Section:

In this view you have a detailed overview of the stats from the game.

In the tabbed interface, you can toggle between "Player" and "Team" views to analyze individual or collective stats.

In the Statistic Table itself, you will find:

Rows representing Player/Team Names.

Columns representing e.g., Kills scores, Assists, etc.). Note that you can hover the column title to get the unabbreviated version.

Comparison Table Section:

This view looks at team performance and compares it against each other. These comparisons can also be implemented as a radar/spider views

If there are any questions, always feel free to reach out to support@grid.gg.

Overview

The GRID APIs are a mixture of REST, GraphQL and WebSocket based APIs.

Within this reference area you'll find individual documentation for each API we offer to you along with which protocol to use for this API.

Feed Overview

Central Data Feed

Query API: a GraphQL API exposing information about titles, tournaments, teams and series (scheduling).

Live Data Feed

Series State API: a GraphQL API exposing the current state of a live series (updated as actions happen during an ongoing game) and the final state of previously played series.

Series Events API: a Websocket API that enables clients to listen for events that are pushed to them as they occur during a live series.

File Download API: a REST API that allows the download of the complete gameplay data of a previously played series.

Access

Access to the GRID APIs is different for every consumer, which can vary on both per API and also for the title, tournament and individual series being accessed.

Bulk Access

Bulk requests are not supported, so instead a single request for every object is required.

Authentication

GRID's APIs use API Keys to authenticate requests, you can manage API Keys by contacting our support team.

These API Keys carry a lot of privilege so try ensure you keep these secret and secure. Don't share these with others, or upload to public spaces such as GitHub.

GRID's APIs utilise two different protocols HTTP and WebSocket, due to limitations our WebSocket API's

REST/GraphQL

As both of these standards utilise HTTP underneath we can use the x-api-key header with the value being that of our API Key provided to you.

var headers = {

	'x-api-key': 'XXX'

}

WebSocket

To access our WebSocket based connections you will need to use a QueryParam appended to the end of the wss url you are using to connect to the API.

wss://api.grid.gg...?key=XXX

All of our requests must be used using SSL therefor please ensure your using HTTPS or WSS endpoints when querying for data.

GraphQL

Authentication

Users of all the GRID APIs must identify themselves before consuming the APIs. The authentication process requires passing a key to the API.

When consuming a GraphQL API, the API key can be passed by setting the x-api-key header in the HTTP request. The way in which this is achieved will vary depending on the specific tool being utilized.

More information about the GraphQL authorization mechanism can be found in the official documentation located at this page.

Pagination

GRID APIs can be used to retrieve all the series for a given time period. While querying for short time periods may yield a small list of series in the response, querying for larger periods, such as a year, would result in larger lists of series. In this latter case, pagination is used to split the results into multiple pages.

GRID APIs maximum page length is 50 results. Thus, a single query will return no more than 50 series. The caller can adjust the page length, and it is currently set to 10 results by default.

Let us consider the following query, which can be found in the GRID Playground. The query requests all the series that started between 03/11/2021 and 04/11/2021, and it will yield the first 10 series from that period.

query GetAllSeriesInNext24Hours {

  allSeries(

    filter:{

      startTimeScheduled:{

        gte: "2021-11-03T00:00:00+01:00"

        lte: "2021-11-04T00:00:00+01:00"

      }

    }

    orderBy: StartTimeScheduled

  ) {

    totalCount,

    pageInfo{

      hasPreviousPage

      hasNextPage

      startCursor

      endCursor

    }

    edges{

      cursor

      node{

        id

        startTimeScheduled

      }

    }

  }

}

The resulting JSON response can be similar to the following:

{

  "data": {

    "allSeries": {

      "totalCount": 32,

      "pageInfo": {

        "hasPreviousPage": false,

        "hasNextPage": true,

        "startCursor": "JAMWBQMjHhoSJBQfEhMCGxITCwtaCwtERUdORUcLC1oLC0VHRUZaRkZaR0QjR05NR0dNR0ct",

        "endCursor": "JAMWBQMjHhoSJBQfEhMCGxITCwtaCwtERUZHRUULC1oLC0VHRUZaRkZaR0QjRkVNR0dNR0ct"

      },

      "edges": [...]

    }

  }

}

To understand this response, it is necessary to examine the following three fields values:

totalCount refers to the number of results matching the given filter.

hasNextPage indicates whether further querying is required to obtain all the results.

endCursor works like a bookmark. It indicates where further queries should start in order to get the next set of results.

Based on the above information, the following query can be executed in order to obtain the next set of results:

query GetAllSeriesInNext24Hours {

  allSeries(

    after: "JAMWBQMjHhoSJBQfEhMCGxITCwtaCwtERUZHRUULC1oLC0VHRUZaRkZaR0QjRkVNR0dNR0ct"

    filter:{

      startTimeScheduled:{

        gte: "2021-11-03T00:00:00+01:00"

        lte: "2021-11-04T00:00:00+01:00"

      }

    }

    orderBy: StartTimeScheduled

  ) {

    totalCount,

    pageInfo{

      hasPreviousPage

      hasNextPage

      startCursor

      endCursor

    }

    edges{

      cursor

      node{

        id

        startTimeScheduled

      }

    }

  }

}

Notably, the after field is set with the value of the endCursor field from the result of the previous query. This ensures that the first item of the returned result is the one following the last of the first query. In order to fetch the entire result set, it is sufficient to keep executing queries, passing the value of the endCursor of the previous result, until the hasNextPage field is set to false.

Instead, in order to get all the results in one query - but always up to 50 - it would be sufficient to specify the first field in the query:

query GetAllSeriesInNext24Hours {

  allSeries(

    first: 50

    filter:{

      startTimeScheduled:{

        gte: "2021-11-03T09:05:39+01:00"

        lte: "2021-11-04T09:05:39+01:00"

      }

    }

    orderBy: StartTimeScheduled

  ) {

    totalCount,

    pageInfo{

      hasPreviousPage

      hasNextPage

      startCursor

      endCursor

    }

    edges{

      cursor

      node{

        id

        startTimeScheduled

      }

    }

  }

}

The first field indicates the number of items we request. This can be any number, from 1 to 50. The first field has a counterpart: last, which allows querying the results the other way around; instead of returning the first X results that match the given filter, the result will include the last X results.

More information on the GraphQL pagination can be found in the official documentation here.

Rate limit

The rate limit restricts the number of queries a user can execute in a time period.

By default, GRID allows 40 requests per minute for Closed Platform and 20 requests per minute for Open Platform. Any more attempts will be rejected.

WebSocket

WebSocket connections allow for two-way communication. Once a connection is opened, either side can push a message to the other side.

WebSocket connections are used to push data to the client. This enables clients to open a connection to listen for data even before it is available. This article presents details about the behavior of WebSocket connections.

Authentication

To confirm the client's identity, information must be passed on to each of the APIs.

When using WebSockets, the client's personal API key is used for authentication, and this information should be passed as a query parameter 'key' when opening a connection. For example, if the client's personal API key is 'secret-personal-api-key', then the URL to open a connection would be:

wss://api.grid.gg/live-data-feed/series/1?key=secret-personal-api-key

Clients can retrieve their personal API key here.

Limits

WebSockets usage is limited by GRID to ensure the system's proper operation, and these limits are applied per personal API key.

Rate limit

The rate limit restricts the client in terms of how many connection attempts can be made within a certain period.

By default, X connection attempts per minute are allowed. Any additional connection attempts will be rejected.

Connection limit

The connection limit restricts the number of simultaneous connections the client can have open at any given time.

By default, Y connections are allowed to be open at the same time. Any additional connection attempts will be rejected.

Duration limit

The duration limit restricts the duration for which a WebSocket connection can remain open. This limit is reset when a Data or Control frame is sent from either side.

By default, a WebSocket connection can remain open for up to 24 hours after the last activity. After this time, the WebSocket connection is automatically closed.

If clients wish to keep inactive WebSocket connections open for a longer period, they can periodically send WebSocket Ping Control frames.

ErrorDetail

Field

Description

DEADLINE_EXCEEDED

The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM

The server detected that the client is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load. HTTP Mapping: 420 Enhance Your Calm Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

FIELD_NOT_FOUND

The requested field is not found in the schema. This differs from

INVALID_ARGUMENT

The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from

INVALID_CURSOR

The provided cursor is not valid. The most common usage for this error is when a client is paginating through a list that uses stateful cursors. In that case, the provided cursor may be expired. HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found Error Type: NOT_FOUND

MISSING_RESOURCE

Unable to perform operation because a required resource is missing. Example: Client is attempting to refresh a list, but the specified list is expired. This requires an action by the client to get a new list. If the user is simply trying GET a resource that is not found, use the NOT_FOUND error type. FAILED_PRECONDITION.MISSING_RESOURCE is to be used particularly when the user is performing an operation that requires a particular resource to exist. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error Error Type: FAILED_PRECONDITION

SERVICE_ERROR

Service Error. There is a problem with an upstream service. This may be returned if a gateway receives an unknown error from a service or if a service is unreachable. If a request times out which waiting on a response from a service,

TCP_FAILURE

Request failed due to network errors. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

THROTTLED_CONCURRENCY

Request throttled based on server concurrency limits. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

THROTTLED_CPU

Request throttled based on server CPU limits HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable. Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

TOO_MANY_REQUESTS

The server detected that the client is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load. HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

UNIMPLEMENTED

The operation is not implemented or is not currently supported/enabled. HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented Error Type: BAD_REQUEST

UNKNOWN

Unknown error. This error should only be returned when no other error detail applies. If a client sees an unknown errorDetail, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error

ErrorType

Field

Description

BAD_REQUEST

Bad Request. There is a problem with the request. Retrying the same request is not likely to succeed. An example would be a query or argument that cannot be deserialized. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request

FAILED_PRECONDITION

The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementers can use the following guidelines to decide between

INTERNAL

Internal error. An unexpected internal error was encountered. This means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error

NOT_FOUND

The requested entity was not found. This could apply to a resource that has never existed (e.g. bad resource id), or a resource that no longer exists (e.g. cache expired.) Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist,

PERMISSION_DENIED

The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.

UNAUTHENTICATED

The request does not have valid authentication credentials. This is intended to be returned only for routes that require authentication. HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized

UNAVAILABLE

Currently Unavailable. The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable

UNKNOWN

Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when an error code received from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error. If a client sees an unknown errorType, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN. Unknown errors MUST NOT trigger any special behavior. These MAY be treated by an implementation as being equivalent to INTERNAL. When possible, a more specific error should be provided. HTTP Mapping: 520 Unknown Error

Enums

ErrorDetail

Field

Description

UNKNOWN

Unknown error. This error should only be returned when no other error detail applies. If a client sees an unknown errorDetail, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error

FIELD_NOT_FOUND

The requested field is not found in the schema. This differs from

INVALID_CURSOR

The provided cursor is not valid. The most common usage for this error is when a client is paginating through a list that uses stateful cursors. In that case, the provided cursor may be expired. HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found Error Type: NOT_FOUND

UNIMPLEMENTED

The operation is not implemented or is not currently supported/enabled. HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented Error Type: BAD_REQUEST

INVALID_ARGUMENT

The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from

DEADLINE_EXCEEDED

The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

SERVICE_ERROR

Service Error. There is a problem with an upstream service. This may be returned if a gateway receives an unknown error from a service or if a service is unreachable. If a request times out which waiting on a response from a service,

THROTTLED_CPU

Request throttled based on server CPU limits HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable. Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

THROTTLED_CONCURRENCY

Request throttled based on server concurrency limits. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM

The server detected that the client is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load. HTTP Mapping: 420 Enhance Your Calm Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

TOO_MANY_REQUESTS

The server detected that the client is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load. HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

TCP_FAILURE

Request failed due to network errors. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

MISSING_RESOURCE

Unable to perform operation because a required resource is missing. Example: Client is attempting to refresh a list, but the specified list is expired. This requires an action by the client to get a new list. If the user is simply trying GET a resource that is not found, use the NOT_FOUND error type. FAILED_PRECONDITION.MISSING_RESOURCE is to be used particularly when the user is performing an operation that requires a particular resource to exist. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error Error Type: FAILED_PRECONDITION

ErrorType

Field

Description

UNKNOWN

Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when an error code received from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error. If a client sees an unknown errorType, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN. Unknown errors MUST NOT trigger any special behavior. These MAY be treated by an implementation as being equivalent to INTERNAL. When possible, a more specific error should be provided. HTTP Mapping: 520 Unknown Error

INTERNAL

Internal error. An unexpected internal error was encountered. This means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error

NOT_FOUND

The requested entity was not found. This could apply to a resource that has never existed (e.g. bad resource id), or a resource that no longer exists (e.g. cache expired.) Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist,

UNAUTHENTICATED

The request does not have valid authentication credentials. This is intended to be returned only for routes that require authentication. HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized

PERMISSION_DENIED

The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.

BAD_REQUEST

Bad Request. There is a problem with the request. Retrying the same request is not likely to succeed. An example would be a query or argument that cannot be deserialized. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request

UNAVAILABLE

Currently Unavailable. The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable

FAILED_PRECONDITION

The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementers can use the following guidelines to decide between

GameType

The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as "4") or integer (such as 4) input value will be accepted as an ID.

Int

The Int scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.

String

The String scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.

Version

Version represented as string using format 'MAJOR.MINOR'

events

Event[]

Array of one or more event objects (see below)

Events

An event is a single, discrete change or action that occurred within the series, such as a player kill, round start, or objective completion. Events include detailed information about the actor, action, target, and the resulting state change.

Field Name

Type

Description

id

String

revertedEventId

String?

(Optional) ID of the event that this event is reverting (only present for reverted events)

Events are structured as {actor}-{action}-{target} (e.g., player-killed-player). The API supports both shared (cross-title) and title-specific events.

Reverted Events

Any event can be reverted if an unexpected issue occurred (for example, due to an admin reset or technical reasons). A reverted event has the same structure as a normal event, but the action is prefixed with an exclamation mark (!), e.g., player-!killed-player.

The revertedEventId field points to the original event being reverted. The delta values in the reverted event are the inverse of the original (e.g., a kill count of -1 instead of +1).

Enums

ErrorDetail

Field

Description

UNKNOWN

Unknown error. This error should only be returned when no other error detail applies. If a client sees an unknown errorDetail, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error

FIELD_NOT_FOUND

The requested field is not found in the schema. This differs from

INVALID_CURSOR

The provided cursor is not valid. The most common usage for this error is when a client is paginating through a list that uses stateful cursors. In that case, the provided cursor may be expired. HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found Error Type: NOT_FOUND

UNIMPLEMENTED

The operation is not implemented or is not currently supported/enabled. HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented Error Type: BAD_REQUEST

INVALID_ARGUMENT

The client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs from

DEADLINE_EXCEEDED

The deadline expired before the operation could complete. For operations that change the state of the system, this error may be returned even if the operation has completed successfully. For example, a successful response from a server could have been delayed long enough for the deadline to expire. HTTP Mapping: 504 Gateway Timeout Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

SERVICE_ERROR

Service Error. There is a problem with an upstream service. This may be returned if a gateway receives an unknown error from a service or if a service is unreachable. If a request times out which waiting on a response from a service,

THROTTLED_CPU

Request throttled based on server CPU limits HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable. Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

THROTTLED_CONCURRENCY

Request throttled based on server concurrency limits. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM

The server detected that the client is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load. HTTP Mapping: 420 Enhance Your Calm Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

TOO_MANY_REQUESTS

The server detected that the client is exhibiting a behavior that might be generating excessive load. HTTP Mapping: 429 Too Many Requests Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

TCP_FAILURE

Request failed due to network errors. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable Error Type: UNAVAILABLE

MISSING_RESOURCE

Unable to perform operation because a required resource is missing. Example: Client is attempting to refresh a list, but the specified list is expired. This requires an action by the client to get a new list. If the user is simply trying GET a resource that is not found, use the NOT_FOUND error type. FAILED_PRECONDITION.MISSING_RESOURCE is to be used particularly when the user is performing an operation that requires a particular resource to exist. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error Error Type: FAILED_PRECONDITION

ErrorType

Field

Description

UNKNOWN

Unknown error. For example, this error may be returned when an error code received from another address space belongs to an error space that is not known in this address space. Also errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error. If a client sees an unknown errorType, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN. Unknown errors MUST NOT trigger any special behavior. These MAY be treated by an implementation as being equivalent to INTERNAL. When possible, a more specific error should be provided. HTTP Mapping: 520 Unknown Error

INTERNAL

Internal error. An unexpected internal error was encountered. This means that some invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken. This error code is reserved for serious errors. HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error

NOT_FOUND

The requested entity was not found. This could apply to a resource that has never existed (e.g. bad resource id), or a resource that no longer exists (e.g. cache expired.) Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist,

UNAUTHENTICATED

The request does not have valid authentication credentials. This is intended to be returned only for routes that require authentication. HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized

PERMISSION_DENIED

The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.

BAD_REQUEST

Bad Request. There is a problem with the request. Retrying the same request is not likely to succeed. An example would be a query or argument that cannot be deserialized. HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request

UNAVAILABLE

Currently Unavailable. The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with a backoff. HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable

FAILED_PRECONDITION

The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementers can use the following guidelines to decide between

GameOrderField

Fields to sort by.

Field

Description

STARTED_AT

-

OrderDirection

Scalars

Boolean

The Boolean scalar type represents true or false.

Duration

Float

The Float scalar type represents signed double-precision fractional values as specified by IEEE 754.

ID

The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as "4") or integer (such as 4) input value will be accepted as an ID.

Int

The Int scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.

String

The String scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.

Widget Overview

GRID Widget embeds allow you to display series, game, and tournament data directly on your website using official GRID data feeds. Widgets are highly configurable, supporting multiple integration methods, internationalization, advanced theming, delay control, and both internal and external data sources. Integration can be customized for different frameworks, with widget types spanning scoreboards, tables, data visualizations, live logs, streams, and map overlays

Integration Approaches

Widgets can be integrated in two primary ways:

Plain JavaScript embed:

Insert the embed script from the GRID CDN and initialize the widget using the provided API.

React Package:

Dynamically load the script and invoke the loadWidget method at the appropriate lifecycle moment with the same properties as in plain JavaScript.

Delays

Widgets use the official broadcast delay by default but may be set to non-delayed (zero) mode for overlays. In non-delayed mode, some sensitive data is omitted for competitive integrity. Secure usage of API keys is required for non-delayed or overlay contexts, and API keys must never be exposed publicly.

External Data Provider Support

Pass a function to the dataProvider property to push a fully custom state into the widget (not using GRID live data). The function receives a setState handler to update widget content at any time. All provided data must match the exact expected state schema for that widget.

Translation and Localization Support

The widget system is built to support flexible internationalization out of the box. All user-visible content within widgets—such as labels, tooltips, section titles, and dynamic messages—can be localized to suit the needs of different audiences and geographic regions. Use the lang property to change the language and the formatting of dates and times. We are using the i18next framework which also allows further customization of particular strings using the translate property.

Widgets Quick-start guide

This guide outlines the fastest way to embed and configure GRID Widgets in your web application, covering both vanilla JavaScript and framework-based integrations. It also highlights required properties, basic customization, and notes for secure deployment.

Embedding a Widget Using JavaScript

Include the GRID Widget Library

Add the GRID Widget script from the CDN in your HTML file

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.grid.gg/widgets/latest/embed.js"></script>

Add a Container Element

Create a DOM element where the widget will render

<div id="widget1" style="height: 200px"></div>

Initialize the Widget

Call the loadWidget method with the desired configuration

window.grid.loadWidget({

  el: document.getElementById('widget1'),

  type: 'series-scoreboard',

  scope: { id: 1 },            

  });

The scope object is mandatory and must match the widget type (e.g., containing a series or tournament ID).

Widget Basic Configuration

grid:loadWidget function

Methods

Code example

window.grid.loadWidget({

    el: document.getElementById('series-table'),

    type: 'series-table',

    scope: {

        type: 'series',

        id: 1,

    },

    options: {

        lang: 'be',

        translation: {

            statistics: 'Статыстыка',

            reset_table: 'Вярнуць да пачатковага стану',

            edit_columns: 'Рэдагаваць слупкі',

            series: 'Серыя'

        },

    },

});

                });

}

Widget Data Source and Delay

Our widget can be used with internal (GRID) and external data.

Internal data source

To use our widgets with GRID data on your own website you need to do the following:

Contact GRID to add your domain in whitelist (localhost is in whitelist)

Configure widget scope. You need to set data type and particular id

window.grid.loadWidget({

     el: document.getElementById('widget1'),

     type: 'series-scoreboard',

     scope: {

       type: 'series',

       id: 42,

     },

   });

Non-Delayed Live Data (Integrity Safe Widgets) (Optional)

There is an option to enable non-delayed data on the widgets. When non-delayed data is enabled, all in-game events will be displayed without any delay on the widgets. However, having this feature enabled excludes several data points as they can potentially cause integrity risk.

Supported Integrity Safe Widgets

Status

How to enable non-delayed live data

To enable non-delayed data, set the "delay" property to "zero" in the options object. This property supports "public" for broadcast speed data or "zero" for live data (excluding some events).

window.grid.loadWidget({

     el: document.getElementById('widget1'),

     type: 'series-scoreboard',

     scope: {

       type: 'series',

       id: 42,

     },

      delay: "zero"

   });

External data source

This option enables you to use our widgets across your portfolio with any data you pass to them even if not supplied by GRID.

How to enable an external data source

To use widgets with external data (powered by you) you need to pass a function and use it to set the widget state completely from your side. Here is an example:

   function externalDataSource(setState) {

     setState({

       data,

       teamColors,

       delay: 0,

       loading: false,

       reconnecting: false,

       error: null,

     });

   }

   window.grid.loadWidget({

     el: 'widget2',

     type: 'series-scoreboard',

     scope: {

       type: 'series',

     },

     options: {

       dataProvider: externalDataSource,

     }

   });

 };

teamColorType

Team color type indicates whether to use team's branding colors or the current title's side colors. The "team" type informs the widget that the colors need to be based on teams’ branding. For example, Fnatic's branding color is orange, which means, their color will be orange. The "side" type tells the widget that the colors need to be based on teams' sides in the game. (i.e CT - Blue, T - Yellow in CSGO)

enum "team" / "side"

apiKey

This key should only be used when the widget is set to "delay: 0" and only in an overlay context. Using it in other contexts will expose your private key publicly. You can find the API key for authorization in your Grid account.

string

displayName*

Allows you to specify a custom name for the dataPoint. Provided displayName will be used in any visualization styles you choose, providing a more meaningful and user-friendly label for the data point.

string

dataSelectionId

Provides a method for accessing specific subsets of filtered data from dataSelection, used when working with conversion rates statistics. The dataSelectionId should be set to the ID of a specific dataSelection item from which statistics will be retrieved.How to set up conversion rates?

string

Example

{

 dataPoint: "won.[value=true].percentage",

 displayName: "Percentage of Wins at Vertigo",

 dataSelectionId: "statisticsFromVertigo",

},

dataPoints convention

DataPoints are strings used to access values from a nested data structure of Stats Feed API. They allow you to specify precisely what data you want to show within the table, even when dealing with complex and deeply nested data.

Examples of dataPoints

kills.avg

This dataPoint points to kills in the data structure and retrieves the value associated with the avg key within.

deaths.avg

Similar to kills.avg, this dataPoint navigates to the deaths key and retrieves the avg value within deaths.

wins.[value=true].sum

This dataPoint handles a conditional extraction. It navigates to the wins key, which is expected to be a list of properties containing value property which is boolean. It then filters this list to include only those dictionaries where value is true and retrieves the sum property value.

Note: To see the whole list of available statistics visit our Portal Documentation (API Overview, API Reference) regarding Stats Feed API query from where this data is coming from. Please remember that query name is already provided same with sampling

Creating Your Own dataPoints

To create your own dataPoints, follow these guidelines:

Dot Notation

Use dots (.) to navigate through the keys of nested objects.

Example: To access the killAssistsGiven avg in a nested dictionary { killAssistsGiven: { avg: 3.45 } }, use killAssistsGiven.avg

Conditionals

Use square brackets ([]) to specify conditions for lists of dictionaries.

Format: key.[condition_key=condition_value].value

Example: If you have a list of dictionaries under the key objectives, and you want to extract entries where type is defuseBomb and then access sum. Which is nested 1 level deeper within completionCount. Datapoint would look like objectives.[type=defuseBomb].completionCount.sum

How to set up conversion rates?

Conversion rates allow us to select statistics only when some filter is true. For example we can select statistics collected only on one or multiple maps for teams. Example of this would this dataSelection item that selects only statistics when on map “mirage” and then shows wins percentage at this map:

{

 id: "mirageMap",

 filter: {

   map: {

     name: {

       contains: "mirage",

     },

   },

 },

}

This then corresponds to setting up CustomDataPoint which has to contain appropriate to dataSelection item, key id.Example of this “dataPoint” would be as:

{

 dataPoint: "won.[value=true].percentage",

 displayName: "Percentage of Wins at Mirage",

 dataSelectionId: "mirageMap",

},

As you can see dataSelectionId has to match id of dataSelection to properly select filtered data. displayName can be whatever you feel is the best at representing this statistic.

List of all available statistics can be accessed through Portal Documentation

Authenticating Your API Requests

If you have encountered the dreaded 401 (unauthorized error), you might need some help figuring out the proper way to authenticate your API requests. Read on for the info you need!

There are two ways to authenticate your API requests. You can either pass the API key into your request as a header, or you can include it in the URL as a request parameter. Note that request headers are a better way to keep your API key secure than request parameters.

NOTE: If you don’t know your API key, ask the admin user for your team to find it in the Account Management > Users area. If you are the admin, you can find Account Management at the bottom of the left navigation bar. Click “View” on the appropriate user in the list, then click where it says “API Keys” to view that user’s API key.

Using Request Headers

Your API key can be sent as part of your request using an “x-api-key” header. See the examples below. In these examples, we are downloading the GRID-formatted end-state data for series ID 2589176.

Python

Below is an example API request, using the built-in requests module.

import requests

headers = {

    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"

}

response = requests.get(

    "https://api.grid.gg/file-download/end-state/grid/series/2589176",

    headers = headers

)

JavaScript

Below is an example API request in JavaScript, using the axios package.

const axios = require('axios');

axios.get('https://api.grid.gg/file-download/end-state/grid/series/2589176', {

    headers: {

       ‘x-api-key’: ‘YOUR_API_KEY’

    }

})

  .then(response => {

    // Interact with the response object as necessary

    // The response body will be contained within response.data

  });

Curl

You can use headers to authenticate a curl request as follows:

curl https://api.grid.gg/file-download/end-state/grid/series/2589176 -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"

Minor variations in curl syntax may be necessary on different platforms (Linux vs. macOS vs. Windows).

Using Request Parameters

Your API key can also be sent using a URL parameter, though this is a less secure method. See the examples below. In these examples, we are downloading the GRID-formatted end-state data for series ID 2589176.

Python

Below is an example API request, using the built-in requests module.

import requests

response = requests.get(

    "https://api.grid.gg/file-download/end-state/grid/series/2589176?key={YOUR_API_KEY}"

)

JavaScript

Below is an example API request in JavaScript, using the axios package.

const axios = require('axios');

axios.get(

    'https://api.grid.gg/file-download/end-state/grid/series/2589176?key=YOUR_API_KEY'

  ).then(response => {

    // Interact with the response object as necessary

    // The response body will be contained within response.data

  });

Curl

You can use a request parameter to authenticate a curl request as follows:

curl https://api.grid.gg/file-download/end-state/grid/series/2589176?key=YOUR_API_KEY

Fetching Lists of Series from the GRID API

Before you can fetch and use the in-game data for the matches available on the GRID Platform (for example, to download your scrim files if you belong to a professional team), you will need to find a list of series IDs for your code to work through. Here's how to get that list, using GRID's Central Data API.

Central Data is a GraphQL API that contains GRID's "static data", such as data about teams, players, tournaments, and series.

For details about how to work with GRID's GraphQL APIs, including details around pagination, rate limiting, and errors, see the GraphQL API Reference documentation.

Preparing and Sending Your Query

To get a list of series that meet certain criteria, we'll use the allSeries query.

Here's a basic example of a simple allSeries query that fetches the most recent 50 Valorant esports series.

In this example, we have used filters to request only VALORANT series and only "esports" series (no scrims).

Endpoint: https://api.grid.gg/central-data/graphql

{

    allSeries (

        first: 50,

        filter: {

            titleId: 6  # Valorant

            types: ESPORTS  # Esports matches only

        }

        orderBy: StartTimeScheduled  # Sort by start time

        orderDirection: DESC  # Sort by most recent first

    ) {

        totalCount

        pageInfo {

            hasPreviousPage

            hasNextPage

            startCursor

            endCursor

        }

        edges {

            node {

                id

                title {

                    id

                }

                tournament {

                    id

                    name

                }

            }

        }

    }

}

Parameters and Filters in this Query

The first: 50 parameter specifies that we want to receive 50 results per page, which is the maximum allowed.

Filters

filter: {

    titleId: 6

    types: ESPORTS

}

The titleId: 6 portion requests the Valorant game title. See below for title IDs for other game titles.

The types: ESPORTS portion requests only esports series (no scrims).

Finally, orderBy: StartTimeScheduled sorts the response by start time, and orderDirection: DESC asks it so sort the most recent first (descending order).

Response Fields in this Query

The totalCount field asks the query to show us how many total series are available using these filters.

pageInfo {

    hasPreviousPage

    hasNextPage

    startCursor

    endCursor

}

These pagination fields give us useful information about which page we are viewing within all of the available pages of results. More on that later!

edges {

    node {

        id

        tournament {

            id

            name

        }

    }

}

This portion of the query asks GraphQL to send us information about each series as an array of "nodes." For more on what "edges" and "nodes" are in GraphQL, see the official documentation.

Within each node, we are asking for the id of the series and the id and name of the tournament to which it belongs. Several other fields are available for series nodes, as listed here.

Filters

There are several different filters you can use to ensure that you are finding all of the series you are interested in, and only the series you are interested in.

To use a filter, simply add it on a line inside the filter: {} portion of your query. Some commonly useful filters are described below, with a complete list available here.

titleId

This filters the result by game title. For example, you can use these values:

VALORANT - 6

LOL - 3

Rainbow 6: Siege - 25

For a complete list of title IDs, see the API Reference.

types

Available series types include ESPORTS (official matches), SCRIM (private practice matches), and COMPETITIVE (Champions Queue).

startTimeScheduled The time the series was scheduled to begin, using UTC. To use this filter, you must provide either a gte paramter ("greater than or equal"), an lte paramater ("less than or equal"), or both. For example, to find series that started between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, you could use this filter:

startTimeScheduled: {

    gte: "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"

    lte: "2023-12-31T00:00:00Z"

}

productServiceLevels

This filter can restrict the results to only show games with certain levels of available data. For example, to only return series with complete live data, you could use this filter:

productServiceLevels: {

    productName: "liveDataFeed"

    serviceLevel: FULL

}

Pagination

Since you can only retrieve 50 records at a time, you may need to submit many queries to fetch a complete list of series that match your filters. You can do this using query pagination.

For a detailed guide to using pagination in your queries, see the GraphQL API Reference documentation.

Requirements

What to Build

Entrants must build or update a working application that uses JetBrains IDEs and Junie and submit it into one of the following categories:

Category 1 - A comprehensive Assistant Coach powered by Data Science and AI: that merges micro-level player analytics with macro-level strategic review. Inspired by Moneyball (Jonah Hill’s Peter Brand), this near-real-time application analyzes historical match data to provide a holistic and actionable review. The platform crunches the numbers to identify recurring individual mistakes and connects them directly to their impact on team-wide macro strategy, generating targeted insights for coaches and players.

Category 2 - Automated Scouting Report Generator: An application that, given an upcoming opponent, automatically scours GRID data from their recent matches to generate a concise scouting report. The report would highlight common strategies, player tendencies, and default site setups (for VAL), or recently played comps (for LoL & VAL).

Category 3 - AI Drafting Assistant/Drafting Predictor (LoL): Develop a tool that analyzes historical GRID data (team compositions, player champion/agent pools, win rates, champion synergies, patch data, recent games history) to recommend optimal draft strategies, picks, and bans against specific opponents in real-time during the pick/ban phase.

Category 4 - Event Game: Develop a mini-game that can be played by fans at a LCS or VCT Event Booth or Finals Activation. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth.

Please read through the Submission Specifics page for full details.

What to Submit

Provide a URL to your code repository for judging and testing.

The repository must contain all necessary source code, assets, and instructions required for the project to be functional. The repository must be public with an approved OSI Open Source License in the About Me section. 

Include a video (about 3 minutes) that demonstrates your submission. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video and made public.

4. How To Enter 

Entrants may enter by visiting cloud9.devpost.com (“Hackathon Website”) and following the below steps:

Register for the Hackathon on the Hackathon Website by clicking the “Join Hackathon” button. To complete registration, sign up to create a free Devpost account, or log in with an existing Devpost account. This will enable you to receive important updates and to create your Submission.

Entrants will obtain access to the required developer tools/platform and complete a Project described below in Project Requirements. Use of the developer tools will be subject to the license agreement related thereto. Entry in the Hackathon constitutes consent for the Sponsor and Devpost to collect and maintain an entrant’s personal information for the purpose of operating and publicizing the Hackathon.

Complete and enter all of the required fields on the “Enter a Submission” page of the Hackathon Website (each a “Submission”) during the Submission Period and follow the requirements below.

Project Requirements

What to Create: Entrants must build or update a working application and are encouraged to use JetBrains IDEs and AI Coding Agent Junie to submit it into one of the following categories (each a “Project”).

Categories:

Category 1: A Comprehensive Assistant Coach: that merges micro-level player analytics with macro-level strategic review. Inspired by Moneyball (Jonah Hill’s Peter Brand), this near-real-time application analyzes alongside historical match data to provide a holistic and actionable review. The platform crunches the numbers to identify recurring individual mistakes and connects them directly to their impact on team-wide macro strategy, generating targeted insights for coaches and players.

Category 2: Automated Scouting Report Generator: An application that, given an upcoming opponent, automatically scours GRID data from their recent matches to generate a concise scouting report. The report could highlight common strategies, player tendencies, and default site setups (for VALORANT), or recently played comps (for VALORANT or League of Legends). 

Category 3: AI Drafting Assistant/Drafting Predictor (League of Legends): Develop a tool that analyzes historical GRID data (team compositions, player champion/agent pools, win rates, champion synergies, patch data, recent games history) to recommend optimal draft strategies, picks, and bans against specific opponents in real-time during the pick/ban phase. 

Category 4: Event Game: Develop a mini-game that can be played by fans at a LCS or VCT event booth or finals activation. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains event booth at Cloud9’s sole and absolute discretion.

Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.

Platforms: A submitted Project must run on the platform for which it is intended and which is specified in the Submission Requirements. 

New & Existing: Projects must be either newly created by the Entrant or, if the Entrant’s Project existed prior to the Hackathon Submission Period, must have significantly updated after the start of the Hackathon Submission Period. Entrants should explain how their Project was significantly updated during the Submission Period.

Third Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, Entrant must be authorized to use them in accordance with any terms and conditions or licensing requirements of the tool.

 

Submission Requirements 

Submissions to the Hackathon must meet the following requirements:

Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements.

Provide a URL to your code repository for judging and testing. The repository must contain all necessary source code, assets, and instructions required for the project to be functional. The repository must be public and open source by including an open source license file. This license should be detectable and visible at the top of the repository page (in the About section).  

Include which category you are submitting to. 

Include a text description that should explain the features and functionality of your Project.

Include a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the Submission:

should be less than three (3) minutes. Judges are not required to watch beyond three minutes 

should include footage that shows the Project functioning on the device for which it was built

must be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook Video, or Youku, and a link to the video must be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website; and

must not include third party trademarks, or copyrighted music or other material unless the Entrant has permission to use such material.

Multiple Submissions 

An Entrant may submit more than one Submission, however, each Submission must be unique and substantially different from each of the Entrant’s other Submissions, as determined by the Sponsor and Devpost in their sole discretion.

Submission ownership

Submissions must be the original work of the Entrant, be solely owned by the Entrant, and not violate the IP rights of any other person or entity.

 

Testing 

Access must be provided to an Entrant’s working Project for judging and testing by providing a link to a website, functioning demo, or a test build. If Entrant’s website is private, Entrant must include login credentials in its testing instructions. The Entrant must make the Project available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the Sponsor, Administrator and Judges until the Judging Period ends. Judges are not required to test the Project and may choose to judge based solely on the text description, images, and video provided in the Submission.

If the Project includes software that runs on proprietary or third party hardware that is not widely available to the public, including software running on devices or wearable technology other than smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers, the Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to require the Entrant to provide physical access to the Project hardware upon request.  

Language Requirements

All Submission materials must be in English or, if not in English, the Entrant must provide an English translation of the demonstration video, text description, and testing instructions as well as all other materials submitted. 

Team Representation

If a team or organization is entering the Hackathon, they must appoint and authorize one individual (the “Representative”) to represent, act, and enter a Submission, on their behalf. The Representative must meet the eligibility requirements above. By entering a Submission on the Hackathon Website on behalf of a team or organization you represent and warrant that you are the Representative authorized to act on behalf of your team or organization.

Intellectual Property 

Your Submission must: (a) be your (or your Team, or Organization’s) original work product; (b) be solely owned by you, your Team, your Organization with no other person or entity having any right or interest in it; and (c) not violate the intellectual property rights or other rights including but not limited to copyright, trademark, patent, contract, and/or privacy rights, of any other person or entity. An Entrant may contract with a third party for technical assistance to create the Submission provided the Submission components are solely the Entrant’s work product and the result of the Entrant’s ideas and creativity, and the Entrant owns all rights to them. An Entrant may submit a Submission that includes the use of open source software or hardware, provided the Entrant complies with applicable open source licenses and, as part of the Submission, creates software that enhances and builds upon the features and functionality included in the underlying open source product. By entering the Hackathon, you represent, warrant, and agree that your Submission meets these requirements.

Financial or Preferential Support 

A Project must not have been developed, or derived from a Project developed, with financial or preferential support from the Sponsor or Administrator. Such Projects include, but are not limited to, those that received funding or investment for their development, were developed under contract, or received a commercial license, from the Sponsor or Administrator any time prior to the end of Hackathon Submission Period. The Sponsor, at their sole discretion, may disqualify a Project, if awarding a prize to the Project would create a real or apparent conflict of interest.

 

5. Submission Modifications

Draft Submissions 

Prior to the end of the Submission Period, you may save draft versions of your submission on Devpost to your portfolio before submitting the Submission materials to the Hackathon for evaluation. Once the Submission Period has ended, you may not make any changes or alterations to your Submission, but you may continue to update the Project in your Devpost portfolio.

Modifications After the Submission Period

The Sponsor and Devpost may permit you to modify part of your Submission after the Submission Period for the purpose of adding, removing or replacing material that potentially infringes a third party mark or right, discloses personally identifiable information, or is otherwise inappropriate. The modified Submission must remain substantively the same as the original Submission with the only modification being what the Sponsor and Devpost permits. 

 

6. Judges & Criteria

Eligible submissions will be evaluated by a panel of judges selected by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion (the “Judges”). Judges may be employees of the Sponsor or third parties, may or may not be listed individually on the Hackathon Website, and may change before or during the Judging Period. Judging may take place in one or more rounds with one or more panels of Judges, at the discretion of the sponsor. 

Stage One) The first stage will determine via pass/fail whether the ideas meet a baseline level of viability, in that the Project reasonably fits the theme and reasonably applies the required APIs/SDKs featured in the Hackathon.

Stage Two) All Submissions that pass Stage One will be evaluated in Stage Two based on the following equally weighted criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):

Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

Technological Implementation:

Does the project demonstrate quality software development? Does the project leverage the JetBrains IDEs or AI Coding Agent Junie (encouraged)? How is the quality of the code?

 

Design:

Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out?

 

Potential Impact:

How big of an impact could the project have on the specific community or target audience?

 

Quality of the Idea:

How creative and unique is the project?

 

The judges will score each criterion out of five (5) points for a maximum total of twenty (20) points. The scores from the Judges will determine the potential winners of the applicable prizes. The Entrant(s) that are eligible for a Prize, and whose Submissions earn the highest overall scores based on the applicable Judging Criteria, will become potential winners of that Prize.

Most Valuable JetBrains Software or Junie Feedback Submission Criteria

IMPORTANT NOTES ON MULTIPLE PRIZE ELIGIBILITY:

An eligible project can only win one (1) prize.

 

Substitutions & Changes: Prizes are non-transferable and may not be substituted by the winner. Sponsor in its sole discretion has the right to make a prize substitution of equivalent or greater value. Sponsor will not award a prize if there are no eligible Submissions entered in the Hackathon, or if there are no eligible Entrants or Submissions for a specific prize.

Odds: The odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries. 

Verification Requirement: Potential winners will be notified of their selection by email. It is Entrant’s sole responsibility to configure Entrant’s settings to be able to accept notifications from Sponsor and/or Administrator. THE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION. No Submission or Entrant shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator. 

Prize Delivery: Prizes will be payable to the Entrant, if an individual; to the Entrant’s Representative, if a Team; or to the Organization, if the Entrant is an Organization. It will be the responsibility of the winning Entrant’s Representative to allocate the Prize among their Team or Organization’s participating members, as the Representative deems appropriate. A monetary Prize will be mailed to the winning Entrant’s address (if an individual) or the Representative’s address (if a Team or Organization), or sent electronically to the Entrant, Entrant’s Representative, or Organization’s bank account, only after receipt of the completed winner affidavit and other required forms (collectively the “Required Forms”), if applicable. The deadline for returning the Required Forms to the Administrator is ten (10) business days after the Required Forms are sent. Failure to provide correct information on the Required Forms, or other correct information required for the delivery of a Prize, may result in delayed Prize delivery, disqualification of the Entrant, or forfeiture of a Prize. Prizes will be delivered within 60 days of the Sponsor or Devpost’s receipt of the completed Required Forms. In the event of any disqualification and/or forfeiture, Sponsor may select alternative winners.

GDC and Travel: As set forth in the table above, each winner of the Category Prizes will receive a Festival Pass ticket to the Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2026 in San Francisco, California (“GDC Event Ticket”), as well as a round-trip flight to and from San Francisco, California and a room in a hotel in San Francisco, California, with the specific hotel and number of nights (up to five (5) nights) determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion (the “All Expense Paid Trip to GDC (Flight & Hotel),” and collectively with the GDC Event Ticket, the “GDC Prizes”). The GDC Prizes are subject to the following: (1) each such winner will receive only one (1) set of GDC Prizes, even if the winner is a Team or Organization, in which case the Team or Organization must select one (1) individual member of the Team or Organization who will receive the set of GDC Prizes; (2) the winner must provide Sponsor with the name and code of the airport selected by the winner for the round-trip flight and any other information reasonably required for Sponsor to book the flight and hotel; (3) the winner must confirm the winner’s ability to attend GDC; and (4) after receiving the required information from the winner, Sponsor will book the flight and hotel and provide the winner with the relevant flight and hotel information as well as the GDC Event Ticket. Each winner is solely responsible for obtaining any visas or any other authorizations (if needed) to enter the United States. If a winner cannot attend GDC (or, if the winner is a Team or Organization, no member from the Team or Organization can attend GDC) for any reason, including failure to obtain the required visas or other authorizations to enter the United States, the winner will not be eligible for and will forfeit the GDC Prizes but may remain eligible for and may receive the remaining Prizes subject to these Official Rules and Sponsor’s sole discretion.

Fees & Taxes: Winners (and in the case of Team or Organization, all participating members) are responsible for any fees associated with receiving or using a prize, including but not limited to, wiring fees or currency exchange fees. Winners (and in the case of Team or Organization, all participating members) are responsible for reporting and paying all applicable taxes in their jurisdiction of residence (federal, state/provincial/territorial and local). Winners may be required to provide certain information to facilitate receipt of the award, including completing and submitting any tax or other forms necessary for compliance with applicable withholding and reporting requirements. United States residents may be required to provide a completed form W-9 and residents of other countries may be required to provide a completed W-8BEN form. Winners are also responsible for complying with foreign exchange and banking regulations in their respective jurisdictions and reporting the receipt of the Prize to relevant government departments/agencies, if necessary. The Sponsor, Devpost, and/or Prize provider reserves the right to withhold a portion of the prize amount to comply with the tax laws of the United States or other Sponsor jurisdiction, or those of a winner’s jurisdiction.

7️⃣ LYNCHPIN DEPENDENCY (MAX FLOW)

🎯 What this answers

What single dependency holds their entire strategy together?

📊 Data used

Winning recipe path

Role coordination reliability

Vision reliability

Spell availability consistency

⚙️ Process

Convert winning path → flow graph

Nodes = roles & systems

Edges = coordination & resource transfer

Capacities = reliability scores

Run Edmonds–Karp

Remove edges one by one → measure flow drop

📦 Final deliverable

Lynchpin

 Jungle–Mid coordination is the primary bottleneck

8️⃣ BREAK STRATEGY
